# strike-news-analysis
This project is creating a corpus of news articles about the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes to be analyzed using Natural Language Processing. Currently the goal is to compare how different types of publications (traditional news, tech news, trade publications) reported on the strike.

Data will be gathered using NewsCatcher API. More info at [https://newscatcherapi.com/](https://newscatcherapi.com/)
